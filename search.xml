    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Original video is made by 吃節操の萌萌兽w. Welcome to Hearthstone Tech #96, let’s continue to see the bugs of Saviors of Uldum we have not finish yet. Will Mogu Cultist having double battlecry summon two Ra?It’s different with what designer has explained. Indeed, at the time of the second battlecry, there is no minions to eat, so It should not summon two highkeeper. What if Shudderwock triggers Cultist’s battlecry?First, Shudderwock will not summon Ra by triggering Cultist’s battlecry. It is probably because the condition of Cultist’s battlecry, is having 7 Cultist on board, not 6 except itself. Secondly, Shudderwock will also not summon Ra by transforming itself into Cultist and then triggering it’s battlecry. It may be a bug. The play requirement of Twilight’s Call is some minions have died.In fact, It’s not just Twilight’s Call, there are lots of confusing mechanisms in Hearthstone. Like you can’t play To My Side! when you have 7 minions, but you can play Call of the Wild. You can draw a card when playing Darkness Candle of The Darkness form hand?After testing, other cards with “Casts When Drawn“ will not draw cards except Darkness Candle. The effect that will draw a card of spells having the keyword “Casts When Drawn“ is already included in this keyword,So it’s normal not drawing cards when you play them from hand. So the Darkness Candle may be a bug. Can Golden Kobold finish the quest of Bazaar Burglary?The Golden Kobold cannot finish the quest, but Golden Monkey can. As explained before, Golden Kobold is transforming the cards, while Golden Monkey is removing cards and then adding cards to your hand. After testing, all the cards that transform your hand cannot finish the quest (including Chameleos, Shifter Zerus and Lilian Voss) What will 0-health Amet do on other minions?It’s normal, but looks incredible, 0-health Amet will also set minions’s health to 0. Plague of Wrath has some strange animation bugs when facing minions that will be moving when they die.Please watch the video.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It’s an English translation of the original article wrtten by 李墨渴Moke. He played this Highlander Even Shaman from rank 5 floor to legend with around 73.1% winrate(38 out of 52)! Let’s check it out! AAEBAfWfAx4zvQHTAfYC8gX+BdkH1Q/WD/IRshS1FMMW96oC+6oCoLYCh7wC0bwClL0C9r0Cws4ClO8CzfQC9ooDnaMD/KMDz6UD2qUD5qUD+aUDAAA= Introduction Is this Highlander Even Shaman an aggressive or control deck? Why can we build an aggressive Highlander deck now? This Highlander Even Shaman is totally an aggressive deck, which is completely consistent with the traditional Even Shaman (jade + big minions) ideas. (go face with big minions, and use spells to end the game) After the appearance of Zephrys the Great, the idea of building Highlander decks has changed. There are three reasons: Shaman’s high-quality even-number aggressive cards in the wild have accumulated very deep. “There are enough cards for Even Shaman to build an Highlander deck.” Zephrys the Great serves as a card “toolbox” to counter all things. Only Even Shaman and Even Paladin’s hero power are for board standing. Why building Highlander Even Shaman? Where is the advantage of Highlander Even Shaman over ordinary one? Is it worth giving up duplicate cards for Zephrys? I think for the wild card pools of Even Shaman, it is worth it. Through the mixed package, the depth of Even Shaman’s card pool is transformed into the advantage of construction, and the advantage is maximized. Of course, there is Reno, but he is not just a gift: Reno Jackson was able to strike the final note with his own strength in the face of such aggressive decks such as Tempo Mage and Mech Hunter. Reno Jackson gave plenty of capital in the face of midrange decks like traditional Even Shaman. Why you build the deck with big minions/Windfury package, not the Even Shaman with other ideas? Generally, there are three aggressive Even Shaman ideas: 1. Big Minions/Windfury 2. Totem 3. Overload/Thunderhead So why can’t the Totem idea make Highlander work? Because the Flametongue Totem is nerfed in the first place, even-numbered high-quality totem cards have just been reinforced. The direct reason is that the totem card pool is not deep enough. Then what about the idea of overload? The direct reason is that the card’s return is not high enough, and the card like Thunderhead makes this Even Shaman not fast or slow and difficult to take advantage of it’s own strengths to win. And the card pool is less than the big minions’s idea. CardsHere is the analysis of all 30 cards in this deck.Not only the reasons for each single card, but also some points that need atten in the actual game. Zephrys the Great Absolute core. Here is a little mention of the most profitable "perfect card": 0 mana Silence: for Doomsayer/Mech Hunter/Taunt 0 mana Sacrificial Pact: for Warlock/Void Ripper 1 mana Hungry Crab: Murloc Paladin/Shaman 1 mana Blessing of Might/4 mana Blessing of Kings: when you have a big minion with windfury 1 mana Whirlwind/2 mana Arcane Explosion: for Odd Paladin 2 mana Flare: Mage/Secret Paladin 2 mana Pain: for Turn 4 Vargoth 3 mana Death: for Even Shaman 3 mana Roar/5 mana Bloodlust: when you have many tokens 3 mana Frost Nova: need go face when you have not Reno 4 mana Shadowflame: when you have Sea Giant on board and face lots of big minions. 5 mana Harrison Jones: for Aluneth 8 mana Lay on Hands: Emergency without Reno Reno Jackson Absolute core. Mulligan Guide: High priority when facing: Tempo/Quest Mage Mech Hunter Odd Rogue Medium priority when facing: Odd Paladin Even/Murloc Shaman Aggro Druid Replace it when facing: Warrior/Priest/Warlock which may not be aggressive. Genn Greymane Just a 6/6/5, You can replace it. When competing for tempo with the aggresive/midrange decks, with other big minions in hand, please play other minions first. But in the face of Priest/Warlock and other late game decks, you can first play Genn when the board is not under pressure to force opponent to play board clear, and then consider the Lich King and other bigs. Murkspark Remember that when your opponent play Psychic Scream and shuffle totems into your deck, it is just a River Crocolisk. Tips: When you don’t have other 2-cost cards in hand, please hit hero power in turn 2, and play Murkspark + hero power in turn 3. Thing from Below In turn 4/5, if you have other bigs in hand, the Thing from Below can stay in hand and continue to reduce cost, and first play other big minions. Sea Giant Always keep it in Mulligan when facing Paladin: even if it’s not Odd Paladin, as long as the** Muster for Battle** is still OP and every Paladin has a copy, it will tell you not to worry about. Although Mech Hunter can also make many tokens(Explodinator), but we shouldn’t keep the Giant in the starting hand, because it will be dead in hand, and will be easily remove by Venomizer. Remember you can get a free totem when you decide to play Giant. Windfury This card is the most valueable component taking the advantage of many bigs in the deck. FAQ: Why using Windfury? Because many big minions in this deck, the profit of going face is very high. Then why don’t you use Windspeaker? The card for executing opponent should has lower cost. When you can kill the enemy, the 2/3/3 of Windspeaker is just a burden. P.S.: When facing slow decks, please keep Windfury in Mulligan, it’s the key card of dealing damage. How about Zephrys? You can find Windfury through Zephrys. Zephrys can also find Blessing of Kings/Bloodlust. What’s more, Zephrys‘s duty is to find “absolutely counter” card like Flare/Hungry Crab. And cause Hungry Crab is 1-mana, Flare is Hunter class card, so we choose to bring Zephrys and Windfury. Totemic Surge Totem’s perpetual Savage Roar. Always keep it in Mulligan. If you decide to play Draenei Totemcarver in turn 3 or turn 4, don’t play Surge to make the totem look harmless (Otherwise, warlocks will Defile) In other cases, you can play it when you have two totems (0 cost 4 attacks). Although the core idea of Highlander Even Shaman is Big Minions/Windfury, while Surge is more inclined to make the board, it is still Even Shaman’s precious, effective and never dead in hand 0-cost card in the current expansion. Totem Golem Your best 2-mana buddy, keep it in starting hand. Needless to say more. When facing Tempo Mage, turn 1’s Coin-Golem can eat her Arcanologist, which can bring you great advantage. Flamewreathed Faceless/Fireguard Destroyer/Draenei Totemcarver Three cards that can most represent “big minions/Windfury” idea. Play them in turn 3/4, and use Windfury on them will deal lots of damage. Keep one or two of them when facing Priest and Warlock, otherwise replace all of them.When you have plural of the three in hand: Calculate the mana next turn and make sure you keep the tempo. They have perfectly different overload numbers, so it’s easy to choose the one that is the most suitable for playing. Draenei Totemcarver is the the most likely one to brick in hand of the three, so if there are totems on board, she is the best choice to play first. In addition to the above conditions, the ranking of board pressure they will provide is naturally: Flamewreathed Faceless&gt;Fireguard Destroyer, and Draenei Totemcarver depends on the number of totems. Jade Claws/Jade Lightning Two traditional op cards. Even if we can not summon big Jade Golem, they are still the best damage package in the whole deck, Aya Blackpaw There are three reasons for using her: The number of 6-cost high-quality cards for Shaman is not very large. Even if we don’t use Aya, we have no better choice. She is not weak at all. She will help summon larger Jade, and the synergies with Claws/Lightning will make her more profitable. If your opponent is unwilling to trigger Deathrattle, then the 5 attacks are enough to use Windfury, which is also in line with the main idea of “Big Minions/Windfury”. Maelstrom Portal/Sandstorm Elemental Keep them when facing Paladin/Rogue/Hunter. Devolve/Hex Hex is the second Devolve, and sometime the role of Hex, even Devolve can not be replaced. Regarding Devolve: It is the best card to deal with Spreading Plague when facing druid. When playing against Mech Hunter, we should keep Devolve in hand as long as we can, and play Hex first. Because Hex can not cope with the stressful board, but Devolve can. Replace Devolve in Mulligan when facing Mage and Odd Paladin. Cause it will probably be dead in hand in the early game. Just using other remove card. Spellbreaker The Spellbreaker has never been a subordinate substitute for Devolve and Hex: At vital turn 3/4, it can deal with Voidcaller/Luna/Brann. And the 4/3 is not just an appendant in the early game. It can silence Voidlord/Lich King in the late game, which help you through the taunt to go face. And the most special thing it can do is to thaw big minion from Mage’s frozen spells and complete unexpected execute. Spellbreaker has always been a good even-numbers card of wild meta, and Highlander archetype gives him more chance to show himself off. Likkim/Splitting Axe Likkim has been a great weapon since its appearance. The overload can be easily meeted, and it will provide up to 9 damage. By contrast, Splitting Axe seems less powerful beacuse of the little totems. But 4 mana 6 damage is already not bad. In addition to the claw mentioned above, we have 3 weapons now, two are 2 mana, and one is 4 mana, having reasonable cost distribution and sufficient quantity. Crackle An extremely rare direct damage spell for Shaman, especially in the absence of one Lightning. Don’t keep it in Mulligan, but don’t be stingy in dealing with threats in the early and mid game. Vessina Beacuse the main idea of this deck is “Big Minions/Windfury”, this card is not suitable for keeping in starting hand even when facing slow decks such as Warlock or Priest(Not the same in Even Totems Shaman). But it’s still a high-quality card even without much tokens on board. Fire Elemental 6/5 and 3 direct damage making Fire Elemental always a good 6 cost card. And it is also appropriate to cooperate with Windfury. Ragnaros the Firelord If we can control the board, Ragnaros will provide precious 8 direct damage. For example, if the opposite is Renolock, in the early and mid game under tight tempo, after he play Twisting Nether, you can play Ragnaros and give him 8 damage to his face! In most cases, this announces your victory. Although Ragnaros is the only big minion who can’t cooperate with Windfury, but don’t forget Spellbreaker, along with Windfury, you can deal 16 damage to the enemy when they are hiding behind many tokens and thinking they are really safe. The Lich King The 6 mana Army of the Dead seems like tailored for Even Shaman for it’s huge number of big minions. It is a precious taunt minion especially when we have only one Thing from Below, and it’s also a big minion which is in line with the deck’s idea. Whirling Zap-o-matic An approximate card of Totem Golem in Highlander Even Shaman. When you have the coin, keep it in starting hand when facing slow classes such as Warlock and Priest. If you make it, it will become an 2 mana Fireball. But don’t keep it when facing Odd Paladin/Mech Hunter, it will be easily removed. And replace it when you don’t have coin! Because regardless of aggressive or control, they can deal with it with the help of the coin. Dire Wolf Alpha It’s a substitute of the second Surge, but it’s useful: It can help your Healing Totem to kill 1/1 for free(Yes it’s you, Odd Paladin!) Don’t keep it when facing Even Shaman/Odd Rogue, beacuse they have many 2-damage. And the same for Secret Mage with Arcanologist. Keep it when facing Mech Hunter. Don’t keep it when facing Priest, because it’s too weak in this match. EVIL Totem For it’s 2 health, it’s mulligan is the same with the Dire Wolf Alpha. It’s a good card though, and can cooperate with Splitting Axe. If you go first and have not Totem Surge, don’t keep it because if you do so, you will have 0 attacks for turn 1 and 2. This is the most likely one to be replaced in the whole deck. The 0/2 is too weak, and the lackeys it gives also have limited help. However, before we have more even number cards, this totem which can help reduce Thing from below is enough to be satisfying.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[4 CN Features Wild Decks to Try]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F28%2FCN_wild_decks_features%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[By comparing Team Rankstar’s and Vicious Syndicate’s wild meta reports with Chinese wild decks, I found that there is something different in several archetypes. Let’s check it out! Odd RogueAAEBAaIHCKICrwT6Dp4QkbwCysMC/eoCnvgCC6gF1AXdCPMRmxWStgKBwgLrwgLR4QKm7wKPlwMA Odd Rogue is also one of the most powerful decks on the CN server, but it tends to play more aggressive because of more control decks in the meta. Corridor Creeper helps little versus aggro but weaker against control. Cube WarlockAAEBAf0GCJMBkwT3BPoOwg/rwgKX0wLb6QILzgbcBvoNjg7nywLy0AKL4QLo5wLY7gLchgOInQMA This Tempo Cube Warlock was originated by 安戈洛属于冬泳欧巴, he posted an article about it in May. After that, it was optimized by team 雾都. The main feature in the CN version of Cube Warlock is that it contains two Sense Demons and cuts Devilsaur Eggs. Sense Demons can help you draw more demons and play the combo of Voidcaller-Doomguard/Voidlord earlier. As to Devilsaur Eggs, you may more willing to play Sense Demons or Voidcaller instead of playing the 3-cost eggs or destroying it. Grim Rally can make an early strong board with tokens and eggs, making it easier versus aggro. Nomi Aggro DruidAAEBAZICCPUNhBeRvALkwgLKwwKdxwLOlAPSmQML9wPmBeUH3hXoFcGrAs27AuvCApvNAovlAsOUAwA= The deck was probably first played by 非分 | 默剑. All the cards are under 3-mana except Hemet and Nomi. Imagine how your opponent feels when he cleans your tokens several times and sees a board with 42 attacks. It should be noted that Nomi is only a utility package. You don’t have to rely on Nomi to win. But if you feel that it is an unfavored match, Nomi is your important means of winning. Aggro PriestAAEBAaCsAwqvBPYHpQn+DfoO9xOEF87MAv3qAtaZAwqhBOUE8gyPD5EP8LsC0cEC2MEC5MIC5fcCAA== The deck is created by 大神灬随便 and he just reached #1 Legend on CN server with around 73.3% winrate. It takes several aggro/buff packages from Inner Fire Priest but cuts Inner Fire and Divine Spirit. You just buff your minions, go face, and use spells to win the game. Special Thanks to Impulse, 游尘 and 南宫那月.]]></content>
