    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Welcome to Ravenholdt! After the mindful patch was released, the nerfed Galakrond Shaman disappeared completely in ladder. The pattern of ladder has shifted from the top 3 of Rogue, Warrior and Shaman to only Rogue’s domination. Before the patch, many decks suppressed by shaman gradually find their position in ranked and continued to refine their constructions. Still, many more decks will be suppressed by the new King. Class Analysis After a month, people finally realized why Rogue’s decks are always strong: Togwaggle and Galakrond. The quality of the 0-mana cards they drew almost determine a win or lose. Basically, these drawn cards are more or less good to play, but sometimes one or two good cards may be the victory of this game. Before the patch, Highlander Galakrond Rogue was more popular because of its fun and resistance towards different decks. But after the patch, as more Highlander Rogue appeared and Galakrond Rogue decks made some improvements, some top players noticed that Galakrond Rogues has the upper hand when facing Highlander Rogues and the improved Galakrond Rogues can play against the aggro decks as Highlander Rogues do. Many players have reached high ranking with Galakrond Rogues. They include the limit pursued Galakrond Rogues with “Spirt of the Shark” represented by “童话” in China, and the tempo Galakrond Rogues constructed by Gyong. He reached the top 1 in AS and EU server. No matter how you construct the deck, Rogue is just too overpowered. Hearthstone is now called “Roguestone.” Because of its playability, rogue’s appearance rate reached 30% in ranked play from 5 to legend. Rogue is absolutely the Tier 0 class. Warrior was also nerfed in this patch. The nerf of “Ancharrr” made Pirate Warrior disappear in ranked. However, the Galakrond Warrior already tended to be aggro before the patch, so the nerf of “Scion of Ruin” didn’t hurt it very bad. New added cards like “Temple Berserker” and “Cruel Taskmaster” made Galakrond Warrior more aggressive at the beginning. Still, occasions like the dying opponents survived after the Galakrond Warriors played their hand are not rare, which means that the aggro Galakrond Warrior still needs improvements. Also, the emergence of Highlander Warrior might be the hope for warriors. Depending on the development by Mr “小米锅巴” and propagation by us, Highlander Warrior popularized both in CN and other servers. Because of its slight advantage towards rogue, Highlander Warrior is at least a Tier 2 deck. In fact, instead of calling it “Highlander Warrior”, we would rather call it “Alexstrasza + Many good Removals Warriors.” The nerf of Galakrond Shaman was so crucial that we think, for a long time, we won’t see Galakrond Shaman in toped ranking anymore. In AS, the win rate of Aggro Overload Shaman has reached the top in all rankings. It is because of its two cores: “Spirit of the Frog” and “Thunderhead.” In EU, Hoej reached good ranking by using a normal Overload Shaman. Also, the Overload Shaman with “Doomhammer” finally can reach to face after “dragon’s pack” was nerfed. At least for now, Aggro Shaman has the potential, but its win rate is still very dependent on the drawn rate of these two cores. Just a few days before the patch, warlock even reached the end of Tier 1 classes in ranked, but the nerf of shaman and warriors made warlock’s status dropped a bit. Both of Galakrond Zoo Warlock and Galakrond Warlock are good against Highlander Rogue, but they are still slightly inferior to the Galakrond Rogues. Besides that, Hand Warlock (not include Galakrond) and Aggro Warlock appears in ranked sometimes, but they are still too bulky. In a word, warlock is a relatively stable class in the current meta. Although it can’t deal with opponents’ wide boards, if you don’t make mistakes, you can win most of the matches, so it is still not a bad deck for laddering. After the patch, as rogue and warlock dominated the ranked play, hunter, known by face damage, has a very suitable laddering environment. In fact, hunter does benefit from the patch. Either Highlander Hunter or Face Hunter decks, despite when the opponents’ hands are good, both can hardly deal with it, can steadily suppress their opponents. Many CN players like to use hunter for laddering in every ranking. “清欢丨祁洛爱叶叶” almost got to the top 1 with Highlander Hunter. We believe Highlander Hunter is strong enough to be one of the Tier 1 decks in the current meta. Our one-sentence summary for Highlander Hunter is: Win like a Face Hunter, lose like a Control Hunter (don’t have such deck). For Face Hunter, the Build by WEHap is nearly perfect. We don’t think it can add or delete any card, especially not taking the “Rat Trap.” The era of Combo Priest has ended. We don’t even want to recommend a Combo Priest deck this week. In this tempo-first environment, Combo Priest with “Magic Carpet” revived. With the tempo play by Carpet, Combo Priest has more operate potentials and board controls. Meanwhile, Resurrect Priest is still tepid, mostly because it can’t defeat rogues and it feels boring, but at least you can play while watching twitch, laughing about Kripp’s silly play and having fun with Face Hunter. While you must realize you will raise rogue’s win rate when playing priest. After the patch, a player named “destiny” won the championship of Power Series League (a Chinese Hearthstone Match Series) by using Highlander Mage and igxc has reached to the top 2 by using Cyclone Mage. It seems to be a hope for mage. However, these two decks rely on key cards too much, and even they have the key cards, they still cannot guarantee to win. But anyway, you can play mage in ranked. Token Druid has some stable and overpowered cards, ensuring the lower limit of it. But when considering its weak board return ability, let’s just skip this deck. For mid-range, druid has Embiggen Druid and Dragon Druid, but both rely on luck. Again, in this tempo-first environment, they are not qualified enough. For Quest Druid, well, it’s Descent of Dragons expansion now. It is just an outdated deck. Paladin is still at the bottom of the class rank. Even though players construct many decks like Highlander Paladin, Mech Paladin, Dragon or Murloc Paladin, their biggest problem is tempo. In many cases, although you have used all mana in every turn, you still cannot stick to the board and defeat opponents. For Holy Wrath Paladin, it disappeared completely in CN’s ranked. Tier List and MethodTier 0 The one deck that control the enviornment, with extreme power. Most of its matchup except the mirror have a repressive advantage. Tier 1 Highly environmentally competitive decks, with high strength and upper and lower limits. The only possible disadvantage is the players’ proficiency and lack of understanding of the game; after skilled use, the winrate is 60% nearly. Tier 2 Decks with high strength in the meta, and one of the upper or lower limit is high; after skilled use, the winrate is around 55%. Tier 3 Decks with a certain level of strength in the meta, generally decks that can be used for special matchups. it has strong stability but is not as versatile as T2 Decks. Tier 4 Decks that can be used to climb the ladder, but the stability is poor or the construction is not complete, and the versatility is also bad.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It’s probably the biggest CN Wild Meta Report ever. Thanks /u/r474nh64’s awesome translation!Note: It’s a meta report of CN region, the meta may be different from your region. Meta AnalysisSince the fall of Sn1p-snap, there has been no dominating deck in the wild ladder creating this engaging meta. New decks are also constantly appearing. So, this meta is a relatively healthy one. Although differing in power level, each class has at least one viable deck. This has caused confusion within the players: With so many viable decks, what should I use to rank up? We will explicate and analyse this meta now: Generally, the wild meta is in transition, with control focusing on an otk or increasing in aggressiveness, aggro having more explosive power, combo increasing in speed or some decks even providing more pressure than aggro. Although technically you can play every deck, aggro and otk are clearly the most dominating decks, with Reno decks struggling due to otk decks increasing in speed. Although combo lacks the scariness of turn 5 otk in snip snap, otking in 10 is very common. Control decks, with their lack of aggressiveness, cannot quickly counter them, and even with more control tools cards like bad luck albatross decrease the viability of reno decks, and the increase in otk decks shut down decks which aim to win in fatigue such as Odd Warrior and jade druid which lack a win condition. Hence, the control decks of now increase in aggressiveness or have a built-in-otk, as we can see from quest reno mage and cubelock. Although reno mage has the worst board clears in the three kabal classes, it excels through its otk capability, a testament to the decline of traditional control decks. Cubelock is an example of a control deck being more aggressive, decks such as egg cubelock and maly renolock have largely replaced decks like jade druid and odd warrior, paving a whole new path in the meta. Let’s focus on the top dogs in the meta: agro and quick otk decks. In a meta that does not reach 10 mana often, the quickest deck wins, with otk decks balancing between speed and strength against aggro. For example, Pirate Warrior and Mechbuff Paladin can use their explosive power to quickly overcome control decks; in contrast, odd rogue which lacks burst struggles in this meta. DH lock has its unique ability to create a huge board early, and with some luck can be even faster than aggro, and if all fails it can rely on its powerful removal spells. As for otk decks, elemental Quest Mage and normal Quest Mage have worse defensive capabilities but are faster than other otk decks, which become the prey for them. Mech’thun warlock has powerful removal spells but is relatively slow and is vulnerable to disruptive tools like mill, so it is not as popular despite seeing an uptick in play. We can look forward to the day when decks like DH lock replaces traditional aggro and otk decks as we compare it to snip warlock. Tech cards have underperformed in this meta, as the multitude of viable decks have made which decks to target less clear; secondly, the faster meta has made players focus on making their own decks more consistent instead of decreasing it by putting tech cards. However, both oozes should be viable in control decks as it is game-winning when used against some aggro decks and skull. Bad luck albatross is very good against control decks, and Golakka Crawler, Eater of Secrets, Chief Inspector, Owl and Spellbreaker are alternative options in this meta. In conclusion, Snip is dead and the meta is better. But as more ‘unfair’ strategies emerge, a deck akin to snip will eventually come back, and aggro, control and otk will cease to exist. Such a powerless situation, like being coin-barnesed and snip on five is terrifying. We hope team 5 can pay more attention to wild and preserve the pristine, diverse meta as of now. What you expect when you face different classes: Druid: Mostly Jade, some Togwaggle. Other druids are either Embiggen or Reno. Hunter: Very hard to predict, but all are aggressive. Odd, Mech and Reno hunter are equal in numbers. Mage: For Quest, mostly Reno, some Elemental and traditional Flamewaker. For non-quest, mostly Secret, some Control Reno. Paladin: Mostly Handbuff, some Odd. Priest: Mostly Reno and Quest, some Big and Inner Fire. Rogue: Mostly Odd, some Mill, Reno and Galakrond. An increasing number of Apothecary Dragon Rogues, but seems to be a phase. Shaman: Mostly Even, some Battlecry. The good warlock matchup in burn Overload Shaman is notable. Warlock: Mostly DH and Cube, some Maly Reno and Mecha’thun. Lesser numbers of traditional Reno. Warrior: Mostly Pirate or Galakrond, some Odd. Tier ListNote that decks are not listed in order inside each level. DecklistsThere are guides for all decks in the original report, but I can’t translate them all. If you are interested in some decks and would like to get the guides, please let me know! DruidNot the most promising meta for druids, jade druid has evolved to become a control deck isntead of putting a lot of jade cards. Aviana-Kun decks can occasionally beat the control deck, but they are all too slow to be good.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[After continuous optimization, the ladder has shown three-legged situation of Warrior, Rogue and Shaman. The three classes crushed the environment with absolute power, and decks like Galakrond Warlock were waiting in the dark to prepare for the death of the current T1 decks. Class Analysis Highlander Rogue is the top acrobatic deck in the environment. The acceptable lower limit and extremely high upper limit allow you to show all kinds of tricks. However, it also requires high skill, so it is not recommended for unskilled players to use it. The deck we feature this week has removed Spirit of the Shark and Devoted Maniac, emphasizing board standing ability in early and mid game as well as the deck’s flexibility.The fancy show of Galakrond Rogue seems to have been found the answer by the CN players. Represented by 惘闻 and WEYuansu, Galakrond Rogue players are gradually combining a powerful and complete deck layer by layer. As of press time, our Rogue expert 惘闻 is trying to hit top from #2 with this deck.As for the brother of Galakrond Deathrattle Rogue and Deathrattle Rogue? We believe that in the current meta, Galakrond Deathrattle Rogue will further nibble Deathrattle Rogue’s territory. Now the Deathrattle Rogue no longer has the significance of anti-Shaman before the patch, not to mention that Galakrond Zoolock is ready to fight. Galakrond Shaman generally carry the Spirit of the Frog components under the guidance of the Silverbyz #1 construction. It speeds up the draw flow and raise up the lower limit, which makes Galakrond Shaman can not only cope with the board pressure and also draw the key cards earlier, so that you can play Dragon’s Pack, Hero Card and Shudderwock that can change the situation. At least as far as this week’s data shows, Galakrond Shaman has sounded the horn of the king’s return. Galakrond Warrior‘s performance on the ladder was commendable, quite the feel of the past Pirate Warrior. On the other hand, the performance of the Pirate Warrior and the Galakrond Pirate Warrior is not disappointing. We did not expect that Garrosh was beaten for so long, and now he was so fierce. 2020 has come, Armor Up is out of date! The sudden rise of Galakrond Zoolock impacts the seemingly stable meta, and with its endless Invoke rhythm, it constantly pressuring Shaman and Rogue’s board, forcing them to be tired of defense and eventually defeats them.As for the Handlock in this environment, it has gradually found its own position. Warlock has done well in this expansion. As an environment counter, Face Hunter can only use their flexible attack to steal few wins.Looks like Highlander Hunter can beat anyone, but in fact it’s not enough to win anyone. After gathering the data of this week, we also changed our previous understanding of Highlander Hunter. We believe that the current construction of Highlander Hunter is difficult to stand on such a violent environment. Albatross Priest and Resurrect Priest have merged. At oresent, the default Resurrect Priest is Albatross Priest, and with the decline of Face Hunter and the unfavorite Highlander Rogue, it can only barely climb the ladder.Combo Priest has almost no good matchup in current enviornment. In the situation where Shaman run double Earth Shock and Hex, and Galakrond Warrior control the enviornment, Combo Priest can only be accidentally injured to become an innocent victim. Murloc Paladin gets some reinforcements in the new expansion, making it of higher quality and stronger suppression in the mid-game. We can foresee that more Murloc Paladin players will emerge in a short period of time, and will gradually become one of the mainstreams of the ladder.Galakrond Shaman‘s return to T1 does not mean that Holy Wrath Paladin can still come out to punish evil and do good, the dual suppression of the Highlander Rogue and Galakrond Warrior makes Uther difficult.And Mech Paladin is more like a toy that can only be played in the lower part of the ladder due to the huge defects of its construction. Druid are really embarrassed. Whether it is Midrange Druid, Treant Druid or even Quest Druid, the falsh of excellent construction can initially catch people’s eyes, but the actual performance is just unsatisfactory. Highlander Mage is almost the same as Highlander Hunter. Although it can not beat anyone easilly, but it can have a even matchup with every deck (provided that it’s not Face Hunter).The Cyclone Mage is more difficult to master and is more depends on the draw-sequence, but after the proficiency comes up, its experience is definitely good. 云中帆, a well-konwn player in CN, also used this deck to reach the top of the ladder. Tier List and MethodTier 0 The one deck that control the enviornment, with extreme power. Most of its matchup except the mirror have a repressive advantage. Tier 1 Highly environmentally competitive decks, with high strength and upper and lower limits. The only possible disadvantage is the players’ proficiency and lack of understanding of the game; after skilled use, the winrate is 60% nearly. Tier 2 Decks with high strength in the meta, and one of the upper or lower limit is high; after skilled use, the winrate is around 55%. Tier 3 Decks with a certain level of strength in the meta, generally decks that can be used for special matchups. it has strong stability but is not as versatile as T2 Decks. Tier 4 Decks that can be used to climb the ladder, but the stability is poor or the construction is not complete, and the versatility is also bad.

    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F29%2FHearthstone_Tech_96%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Original video is made by 吃節操の萌萌兽w. Welcome to Hearthstone Tech #96, let’s continue to see the bugs of Saviors of Uldum we have not finish yet. Will Mogu Cultist having double battlecry summon two Ra?It’s different with what designer has explained. Indeed, at the time of the second battlecry, there is no minions to eat, so It should not summon two highkeeper. What if Shudderwock triggers Cultist’s battlecry?First, Shudderwock will not summon Ra by triggering Cultist’s battlecry. It is probably because the condition of Cultist’s battlecry, is having 7 Cultist on board, not 6 except itself. Secondly, Shudderwock will also not summon Ra by transforming itself into Cultist and then triggering it’s battlecry. It may be a bug. The play requirement of Twilight’s Call is some minions have died.In fact, It’s not just Twilight’s Call, there are lots of confusing mechanisms in Hearthstone. Like you can’t play To My Side! when you have 7 minions, but you can play Call of the Wild. You can draw a card when playing Darkness Candle of The Darkness form hand?After testing, other cards with “Casts When Drawn“ will not draw cards except Darkness Candle. The effect that will draw a card of spells having the keyword “Casts When Drawn“ is already included in this keyword,So it’s normal not drawing cards when you play them from hand. So the Darkness Candle may be a bug. Can Golden Kobold finish the quest of Bazaar Burglary?The Golden Kobold cannot finish the quest, but Golden Monkey can. As explained before, Golden Kobold is transforming the cards, while Golden Monkey is removing cards and then adding cards to your hand. After testing, all the cards that transform your hand cannot finish the quest (including Chameleos, Shifter Zerus and Lilian Voss) What will 0-health Amet do on other minions?It’s normal, but looks incredible, 0-health Amet will also set minions’s health to 0. Plague of Wrath has some strange animation bugs when facing minions that will be moving when they die.Please watch the video.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Highlander Even Shaman Deck List Guide]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F11%2FHighlander-Even-Shaman-Deck-List-Guide%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It’s an English translation of the original article wrtten by 李墨渴Moke. He played this Highlander Even Shaman from rank 5 floor to legend with around 73.1% winrate(38 out of 52)! Let’s check it out! AAEBAfWfAx4zvQHTAfYC8gX+BdkH1Q/WD/IRshS1FMMW96oC+6oCoLYCh7wC0bwClL0C9r0Cws4ClO8CzfQC9ooDnaMD/KMDz6UD2qUD5qUD+aUDAAA= Introduction Is this Highlander Even Shaman an aggressive or control deck? Why can we build an aggressive Highlander deck now? This Highlander Even Shaman is totally an aggressive deck, which is completely consistent with the traditional Even Shaman (jade + big minions) ideas. (go face with big minions, and use spells to end the game) After the appearance of Zephrys the Great, the idea of building Highlander decks has changed. There are three reasons: Shaman’s high-quality even-number aggressive cards in the wild have accumulated very deep. “There are enough cards for Even Shaman to build an Highlander deck.” Zephrys the Great serves as a card “toolbox” to counter all things. Only Even Shaman and Even Paladin’s hero power are for board standing. Why building Highlander Even Shaman? Where is the advantage of Highlander Even Shaman over ordinary one? Is it worth giving up duplicate cards for Zephrys? I think for the wild card pools of Even Shaman, it is worth it. Through the mixed package, the depth of Even Shaman’s card pool is transformed into the advantage of construction, and the advantage is maximized. Of course, there is Reno, but he is not just a gift: Reno Jackson was able to strike the final note with his own strength in the face of such aggressive decks such as Tempo Mage and Mech Hunter. Reno Jackson gave plenty of capital in the face of midrange decks like traditional Even Shaman. Why you build the deck with big minions/Windfury package, not the Even Shaman with other ideas? Generally, there are three aggressive Even Shaman ideas: 1. Big Minions/Windfury 2. Totem 3. Overload/Thunderhead So why can’t the Totem idea make Highlander work? Because the Flametongue Totem is nerfed in the first place, even-numbered high-quality totem cards have just been reinforced. The direct reason is that the totem card pool is not deep enough. Then what about the idea of overload? The direct reason is that the card’s return is not high enough, and the card like Thunderhead makes this Even Shaman not fast or slow and difficult to take advantage of it’s own strengths to win. And the card pool is less than the big minions’s idea. CardsHere is the analysis of all 30 cards in this deck.Not only the reasons for each single card, but also some points that need atten in the actual game. Zephrys the Great Absolute core. Here is a little mention of the most profitable "perfect card": 0 mana Silence: for Doomsayer/Mech Hunter/Taunt 0 mana Sacrificial Pact: for Warlock/Void Ripper 1 mana Hungry Crab: Murloc Paladin/Shaman 1 mana Blessing of Might/4 mana Blessing of Kings: when you have a big minion with windfury 1 mana Whirlwind/2 mana Arcane Explosion: for Odd Paladin 2 mana Flare: Mage/Secret Paladin 2 mana Pain: for Turn 4 Vargoth 3 mana Death: for Even Shaman 3 mana Roar/5 mana Bloodlust: when you have many tokens 3 mana Frost Nova: need go face when you have not Reno 4 mana Shadowflame: when you have Sea Giant on board and face lots of big minions. 5 mana Harrison Jones: for Aluneth 8 mana Lay on Hands: Emergency without Reno Reno Jackson Absolute core. Mulligan Guide: High priority when facing: Tempo/Quest Mage Mech Hunter Odd Rogue Medium priority when facing: Odd Paladin Even/Murloc Shaman Aggro Druid Replace it when facing: Warrior/Priest/Warlock which may not be aggressive. Genn Greymane Just a 6/6/5, You can replace it. When competing for tempo with the aggresive/midrange decks, with other big minions in hand, please play other minions first. But in the face of Priest/Warlock and other late game decks, you can first play Genn when the board is not under pressure to force opponent to play board clear, and then consider the Lich King and other bigs. Murkspark Remember that when your opponent play Psychic Scream and shuffle totems into your deck, it is just a River Crocolisk. Tips: When you don’t have other 2-cost cards in hand, please hit hero power in turn 2, and play Murkspark + hero power in turn 3. Thing from Below In turn 4/5, if you have other bigs in hand, the Thing from Below can stay in hand and continue to reduce cost, and first play other big minions. Sea Giant Always keep it in Mulligan when facing Paladin: even if it’s not Odd Paladin, as long as the** Muster for Battle** is still OP and every Paladin has a copy, it will tell you not to worry about. Although Mech Hunter can also make many tokens(Explodinator), but we shouldn’t keep the Giant in the starting hand, because it will be dead in hand, and will be easily remove by Venomizer. Remember you can get a free totem when you decide to play Giant. Windfury This card is the most valueable component taking the advantage of many bigs in the deck. FAQ: Why using Windfury? Because many big minions in this deck, the profit of going face is very high. Then why don’t you use Windspeaker? The card for executing opponent should has lower cost. When you can kill the enemy, the 2/3/3 of Windspeaker is just a burden. P.S.: When facing slow decks, please keep Windfury in Mulligan, it’s the key card of dealing damage. How about Zephrys? You can find Windfury through Zephrys. Zephrys can also find Blessing of Kings/Bloodlust. What’s more, Zephrys‘s duty is to find “absolutely counter” card like Flare/Hungry Crab. And cause Hungry Crab is 1-mana, Flare is Hunter class card, so we choose to bring Zephrys and Windfury. Totemic Surge Totem’s perpetual Savage Roar. Always keep it in Mulligan. If you decide to play Draenei Totemcarver in turn 3 or turn 4, don’t play Surge to make the totem look harmless (Otherwise, warlocks will Defile) In other cases, you can play it when you have two totems (0 cost 4 attacks). Although the core idea of Highlander Even Shaman is Big Minions/Windfury, while Surge is more inclined to make the board, it is still Even Shaman’s precious, effective and never dead in hand 0-cost card in the current expansion. Totem Golem Your best 2-mana buddy, keep it in starting hand. Needless to say more. When facing Tempo Mage, turn 1’s Coin-Golem can eat her Arcanologist, which can bring you great advantage. Flamewreathed Faceless/Fireguard Destroyer/Draenei Totemcarver Three cards that can most represent “big minions/Windfury” idea. Play them in turn 3/4, and use Windfury on them will deal lots of damage. Keep one or two of them when facing Priest and Warlock, otherwise replace all of them.When you have plural of the three in hand: Calculate the mana next turn and make sure you keep the tempo. They have perfectly different overload numbers, so it’s easy to choose the one that is the most suitable for playing. Draenei Totemcarver is the the most likely one to brick in hand of the three, so if there are totems on board, she is the best choice to play first. In addition to the above conditions, the ranking of board pressure they will provide is naturally: Flamewreathed Faceless&gt;Fireguard Destroyer, and Draenei Totemcarver depends on the number of totems. Jade Claws/Jade Lightning Two traditional op cards. Even if we can not summon big Jade Golem, they are still the best damage package in the whole deck, Aya Blackpaw There are three reasons for using her: The number of 6-cost high-quality cards for Shaman is not very large. Even if we don’t use Aya, we have no better choice. She is not weak at all. She will help summon larger Jade, and the synergies with Claws/Lightning will make her more profitable. If your opponent is unwilling to trigger Deathrattle, then the 5 attacks are enough to use Windfury, which is also in line with the main idea of “Big Minions/Windfury”. Maelstrom Portal/Sandstorm Elemental Keep them when facing Paladin/Rogue/Hunter. Devolve/Hex Hex is the second Devolve, and sometime the role of Hex, even Devolve can not be replaced. Regarding Devolve: It is the best card to deal with Spreading Plague when facing druid. When playing against Mech Hunter, we should keep Devolve in hand as long as we can, and play Hex first. Because Hex can not cope with the stressful board, but Devolve can. Replace Devolve in Mulligan when facing Mage and Odd Paladin. Cause it will probably be dead in hand in the early game. Just using other remove card. Spellbreaker The Spellbreaker has never been a subordinate substitute for Devolve and Hex: At vital turn 3/4, it can deal with Voidcaller/Luna/Brann. And the 4/3 is not just an appendant in the early game. It can silence Voidlord/Lich King in the late game, which help you through the taunt to go face. And the most special thing it can do is to thaw big minion from Mage’s frozen spells and complete unexpected execute. Spellbreaker has always been a good even-numbers card of wild meta, and Highlander archetype gives him more chance to show himself off. Likkim/Splitting Axe Likkim has been a great weapon since its appearance. The overload can be easily meeted, and it will provide up to 9 damage. By contrast, Splitting Axe seems less powerful beacuse of the little totems. But 4 mana 6 damage is already not bad. In addition to the claw mentioned above, we have 3 weapons now, two are 2 mana, and one is 4 mana, having reasonable cost distribution and sufficient quantity. Crackle An extremely rare direct damage spell for Shaman, especially in the absence of one Lightning. Don’t keep it in Mulligan, but don’t be stingy in dealing with threats in the early and mid game. Vessina Beacuse the main idea of this deck is “Big Minions/Windfury”, this card is not suitable for keeping in starting hand even when facing slow decks such as Warlock or Priest(Not the same in Even Totems Shaman). But it’s still a high-quality card even without much tokens on board. Fire Elemental 6/5 and 3 direct damage making Fire Elemental always a good 6 cost card. And it is also appropriate to cooperate with Windfury. Ragnaros the Firelord If we can control the board, Ragnaros will provide precious 8 direct damage. For example, if the opposite is Renolock, in the early and mid game under tight tempo, after he play Twisting Nether, you can play Ragnaros and give him 8 damage to his face! In most cases, this announces your victory. Although Ragnaros is the only big minion who can’t cooperate with Windfury, but don’t forget Spellbreaker, along with Windfury, you can deal 16 damage to the enemy when they are hiding behind many tokens and thinking they are really safe. The Lich King The 6 mana Army of the Dead seems like tailored for Even Shaman for it’s huge number of big minions. It is a precious taunt minion especially when we have only one Thing from Below, and it’s also a big minion which is in line with the deck’s idea. Whirling Zap-o-matic An approximate card of Totem Golem in Highlander Even Shaman. When you have the coin, keep it in starting hand when facing slow classes such as Warlock and Priest. If you make it, it will become an 2 mana Fireball. But don’t keep it when facing Odd Paladin/Mech Hunter, it will be easily removed. And replace it when you don’t have coin! Because regardless of aggressive or control, they can deal with it with the help of the coin. Dire Wolf Alpha It’s a substitute of the second Surge, but it’s useful: It can help your Healing Totem to kill 1/1 for free(Yes it’s you, Odd Paladin!) Don’t keep it when facing Even Shaman/Odd Rogue, beacuse they have many 2-damage. And the same for Secret Mage with Arcanologist. Keep it when facing Mech Hunter. Don’t keep it when facing Priest, because it’s too weak in this match. EVIL Totem For it’s 2 health, it’s mulligan is the same with the Dire Wolf Alpha. It’s a good card though, and can cooperate with Splitting Axe. If you go first and have not Totem Surge, don’t keep it because if you do so, you will have 0 attacks for turn 1 and 2. This is the most likely one to be replaced in the whole deck. The 0/2 is too weak, and the lackeys it gives also have limited help. However, before we have more even number cards, this totem which can help reduce Thing from below is enough to be satisfying.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[4 CN Features Wild Decks to Try]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F28%2FCN_wild_decks_features%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[By comparing Team Rankstar’s and Vicious Syndicate’s wild meta reports with Chinese wild decks, I found that there is something different in several archetypes. Let’s check it out! Odd RogueAAEBAaIHCKICrwT6Dp4QkbwCysMC/eoCnvgCC6gF1AXdCPMRmxWStgKBwgLrwgLR4QKm7wKPlwMA Odd Rogue is also one of the most powerful decks on the CN server, but it tends to play more aggressive because of more control decks in the meta. Corridor Creeper helps little versus aggro but weaker against control. Cube WarlockAAEBAf0GCJMBkwT3BPoOwg/rwgKX0wLb6QILzgbcBvoNjg7nywLy0AKL4QLo5wLY7gLchgOInQMA This Tempo Cube Warlock was originated by 安戈洛属于冬泳欧巴, he posted an article about it in May. After that, it was optimized by team 雾都. The main feature in the CN version of Cube Warlock is that it contains two Sense Demons and cuts Devilsaur Eggs. Sense Demons can help you draw more demons and play the combo of Voidcaller-Doomguard/Voidlord earlier. As to Devilsaur Eggs, you may more willing to play Sense Demons or Voidcaller instead of playing the 3-cost eggs or destroying it. Grim Rally can make an early strong board with tokens and eggs, making it easier versus aggro. Nomi Aggro DruidAAEBAZICCPUNhBeRvALkwgLKwwKdxwLOlAPSmQML9wPmBeUH3hXoFcGrAs27AuvCApvNAovlAsOUAwA= The deck was probably first played by 非分 | 默剑. All the cards are under 3-mana except Hemet and Nomi. Imagine how your opponent feels when he cleans your tokens several times and sees a board with 42 attacks. It should be noted that Nomi is only a utility package. You don’t have to rely on Nomi to win. But if you feel that it is an unfavored match, Nomi is your important means of winning. Aggro PriestAAEBAaCsAwqvBPYHpQn+DfoO9xOEF87MAv3qAtaZAwqhBOUE8gyPD5EP8LsC0cEC2MEC5MIC5fcCAA== The deck is created by 大神灬随便 and he just reached #1 Legend on CN server with around 73.3% winrate. It takes several aggro/buff packages from Inner Fire Priest but cuts Inner Fire and Divine Spirit. You just buff your minions, go face, and use spells to win the game. Special Thanks to Impulse, 游尘 and 南宫那月.]]></content>
